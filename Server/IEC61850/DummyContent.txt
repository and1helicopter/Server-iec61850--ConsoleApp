This file is here to trick NuGet into installing the package.
Without the file, NuGet complains with an error along the lines of:

Install-Package : Could not install package 'Tigra.CodeContracts.MSBuild 
1.7.11202.1005'. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 
'.NETFramework,Version=v4.6', but the package does not contain any assembly 
references or content files that are compatible with that framework. For more 
information, contact the package author.

This file is installed in the generic '.net' folder and _should_ match any version
of the .net framework.
